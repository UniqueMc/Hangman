# Hangman Game

This is a classic Hangman game built with React using class‑based components. In this game, a random word is selected from a preset list and you must guess the letters to reveal the hidden word. With every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of allowed mistakes.
